<!-- # 预学习概述

从第三期"一生一芯"开始, 我们收到了很多同学类似`我零基础, 但很热爱学习, 能否参加"一生一芯"`的询问.
毫无疑问, 我们非常欢迎如此热爱学习的同学参加.
但我们也需要尊重学习的规律: 零基础的同学按道理就应该花更多的时间把基础打好, 然后再进入正式的学习阶段.
因此"一生一芯"设置了预学习阶段, 供大家检查自己是否已经掌握了足够的知识基础来进入正式的学习阶段.

预学习阶段主要包含以下内容:
1. 阅读两篇关于如何提问的文章, 编写一篇不少于800字的读后感
1. Linux系统安装(PA0)和基本使用
1. 复习C语言知识
1. 搭建verilator仿真环境
1. 完成指定的所有数字电路基础实验
1. 完成PA1阶段1

完成上述内容后, 你就可以申请参加预学习的答辩了. 通过答辩即可进入"一生一芯"的正式学习阶段. -->

[#](#Overview-of-pre-study) Overview of pre-study
=================

Since the cohort 3, we have received a lot of inquiries like "I have no prior knowledge, but love to learn, can I join the ysyx program". Without a doubt, we are very happy to welcome students who love learning so much. But we also need to respect the rules of learning: those who have no basic knowledge should spend more time to build up a good foundation before entering the formal learning stage. That's why ysyx has set up a pre-study phase, so that you can check whether you have acquired enough knowledge to enter the formal learning phase.

The pre-study phase consists of the following elements.

1. log your study everyday, refer to [Study log Sheet (Template)](https://docs.qq.com/sheet/DT2RPaWFzVGlzaG1T), which is necessary for subsequent tape out.
2. Read two articles on how to ask questions, and write an essay of no less than 800 words after reading them.
3. complete the installation of Linux (PA0).
4. set up the verilator simulation environment, note the use of specific versions.
5. complete the installation of the Linux system and the mandatory exercises of the basic section.
6. complete the required digital circuits exercises.
7. complete the required C language exercises
8. complete all the contents of the PA1

Once you have completed the above, you can apply for the ysyx defense, and if you pass the defense, you will be admitted to the official ysyx stage. Please follow the instructions in the handout.

<!-- > #### caution::不用慌
> 我们设置预学习的答辩, 并不是为了筛选出优秀的同学, 而把零基础的同学刷掉;
> 相反, 我们是希望大家做好进入正式学习阶段的准备:
> 你很可能会在正式学习阶段的一开始就发现陌生的知识像潮水一般涌来.
> 如何在将来遇到的困难中存活下来是至关重要的,
> 但我们在预学习阶段就会给大家透露存活的秘诀. -->

#### There's no need to panic.

We don't set up the admission defense in order to filter out the best students and eliminate those with no knowledge; on the contrary, we want you to be prepared to enter the official phase of the course: you will probably find a tidal wave of unfamiliar knowledge at the beginning of the official phase of the course. How you survive the difficulties you will encounter in the future is of paramount importance, but we will give you the secret of survival in the pre-study phase.


<!-- > #### comment::这些我都已经掌握了, 我能跳过预学习吗?
> 准确地说, 你可以跳过大部分内容, 但以下内容仍然不可以跳过:
> 1. 编写关于如何提问的读后感
> 1. 获取"一生一芯"框架代码
> 1. 搭建verilator环境, 因为这是"一生一芯"开发环境的一部分
> 1. 完成PA1阶段1, 因为后续模拟器和系统软件相关的内容将会围绕PA开展
>
> 当然, 如果你确实已经具备很好的基础, 完成上述内容也不会花费太多时间.
> 但请注意, 如果因为不想写学习记录和实验报告而跳过预学习,
> 是非常不恰当的, 这会为你未来的学习增加很多额外的负担. -->

> #### comment::I've mastered all of this, can I skip the pre-study?
> To be precise, you can skip most of the content, but you still can't skip the following.
> 1. write an eassy on how to ask questions
> 1. getting the code for the ysyx framework
> 1. install the verilator environment, as it is part of the ysyx development environment.
> 1. Complete PA1 Phase 1, as the subsequent simulator and system software related content will be centered around PA.
>
> Of course, if you do have a good foundation, it won't take long to complete the above.
> 
> Please note, however, that skipping the pre-study because you don't want to write an essay or lab report is highly inappropriate and will add a lot of extra burden to your future studies.

#### Pre-study guides (teaching assistants are involved to provide guidance and communication)

After learning [how to ask smart questions](/docs/2306/prestudy/0.1.html), welcome to join the [pre-study IM group (QQ)](https://docs.qq.com/doc/DSU1teVZLR1hDcG9P), where you can happily complete the pre-study together and move towards Become a formal student of ysyx!
